# AKE-over-CoAP
## Introduction
This is the self-documenting implementation for the paper **LAKEE: A Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol for Power Constrained Devices**. The client and the server perform a LAKEE handshake and establish a short-term key with **Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH)**. The developers are aware that this is not the most efficient way to implement the protocol. The code serves as a practical guideline for the protocol and helps to estimate its overhead.
